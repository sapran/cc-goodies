# shell-guard

A `PreToolUse` hook that **blocks a small, curated set of catastrophic shell
commands before they run**. When Claude's Bash tool tries something that would wipe
your home directory, reformat a disk, or pipe a download straight into a shell, the
command is denied (exit 2) and Claude is told why — instead of finding out afterwards.

It only ever gates **Claude's Bash tool**. You can still run any command yourself in
a terminal.

This is **defence in depth** on top of the static `permissions.deny` list in
`~/.claude/settings.json`. That list matches command *strings* exactly, so it misses
re-ordered flags, extra spaces, or `$HOME` in place of `~`. shell-guard normalises the
flags and resolves the delete target, catching the obfuscated variants. It is a
convenience guard, not a sandbox — keep real OS-level backups and protections too.

## What it blocks

Each is matched after normalising flags/spacing, not by naïve substring match:

- **Recursive delete of a protected path** — `rm -rf` / `-fr` / `-r --force` /
  `--recursive --force` (any order) whose target is `/`, `/*`, `~`, `$HOME`, a
  top-level system dir (`/usr`, `/etc`, `/System`, `/Library`, …), or — only when the
  session's cwd **is** your home directory — a bare `*` / `.*` / `.`. Also any
  `rm --no-preserve-root`.
- **`dd` onto a device** — `dd … of=/dev/…`.
- **Filesystem create/wipe** — `mkfs`, `mkfs.*`, `wipefs`, `newfs`, `newfs_*`.
- **Destructive `diskutil`** — `eraseDisk`, `eraseVolume`, `reformat`, `zeroDisk`,
  `secureErase`, `partitionDisk`, `eraseall`.
- **Redirect onto a raw disk device** — `> /dev/disk*`, `/dev/rdisk*`, `/dev/sd*`,
  `/dev/hd*`, `/dev/nvme*`, `/dev/vd*` (but **not** `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, a tty…).
- **Fork bomb** — a function that pipes and backgrounds a call to itself
  (`:(){ :|:& };:` and renamed variants).
- **Network download piped into a shell** — `curl`/`wget`/`fetch` piped into
  `sh`/`bash`/`zsh`/`dash` (including via `sudo`, and `bash <(curl …)`).
- Anything in your `SHELL_GUARD_EXTRA_PATTERNS` (see **Configure**).

Compound commands are split on `&&`, `||`, `;` and newlines and judged piece by piece,
so `git pull && rm -rf /` is caught.

## What it deliberately allows

The block list is intentionally tight to avoid breaking normal work:

- `rm -rf ./build`, `rm -rf node_modules`, `rm -rf dist` — relative/project paths.
- `rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules/foo` — a deep path under a system dir (only the
  bare top-level dir is protected).
- `rm -rf *` **outside** your home directory.
- `dd if=a.img of=out.img` — `dd` to a regular file.
- `curl … | jq`, `curl … | ssh host`, `curl … -o file` — downloads that don't feed a shell.
- `echo "rm -rf /"` — the dangerous text is an argument, not the command.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add sapran/cc-goodies
/plugin install shell-guard@cc-goodies
```

The hook activates on install (restart or `/hooks` to load it). Run `/shell-guard` any
time to pause it or add extra patterns.

## Configure

Settings resolve **environment variable → `~/.claude/shell-guard.conf` → built-in
default** (env wins). The conf file is a plain `KEY=VALUE` list, read fresh on every
command, so changes take effect immediately — no restart.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `SHELL_GUARD_DISABLE` | *(unset)* | Set to `1` to pause the guard without uninstalling |
| `SHELL_GUARD_EXTRA_PATTERNS` | *(unset)* | Extra ERE block patterns, `;`- or newline-separated |

`SHELL_GUARD_EXTRA_PATTERNS` are raw regular expressions matched against each command
segment — keep them specific, a broad pattern blocks a lot. Example
`~/.claude/shell-guard.conf`:

```sh
SHELL_GUARD_EXTRA_PATTERNS="git clean -fdx"
```

The easiest way to edit it is the `/shell-guard` command, which shows the current state
and writes the file for you.

## Uninstall

```text
/shell-guard-uninstall
/plugin uninstall shell-guard@cc-goodies
```

`/shell-guard-uninstall` deletes the `~/.claude/shell-guard.conf` it created (after
confirmation); `/plugin uninstall` then removes the plugin and its hook.

To **pause** without removing, set `SHELL_GUARD_DISABLE=1` (via `/shell-guard`, or as a
line in `~/.claude/shell-guard.conf`): the guard no-ops but stays installed.

## Limitations

- **Best-effort shell parsing.** Exotic quoting, variable indirection, or `eval` can
  hide an operation — this is a convenience guard, not a sandbox. Pair it with real
  backups and OS-level protections for anything that matters.
- **Curated, not exhaustive.** It targets a high-confidence catastrophic set and stays
  out of the way of normal work; it will not catch every destructive command. Add your
  own via `SHELL_GUARD_EXTRA_PATTERNS`.
- **The cwd glob-all check only fires for `$HOME` itself.** `rm -rf *` is blocked when
  the session sits in your home directory, but not in an arbitrary directory (it can't
  know what `*` expands to there).
- **Requires `jq`** to parse the hook input. If `jq` is missing the guard prints a
  one-line warning and **allows** the command (it fails open rather than blocking every
  Bash call). `brew install jq` to enable it.

## Requirements

- `jq` and `bash` — cross-platform.
